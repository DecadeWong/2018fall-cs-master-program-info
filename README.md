# 2018fall-cs-master-program-info
A collection of information for 2018 fall CS master programs.
See [.pdf](https://github.com/wenhanshi/2018fall-cs-master-program-info/blob/master/admission.pdf) for details.

## For BUPTers

Initially, this collection is only designed for preparing the applications for 2018-fall CS master programs. Generally, I prefer __professional__ master programs, which are __more than 1 year__, in the fields of __Computer Science__ and __Data Science__.

We're sharing them here for all BUPTers to learn more about programs, including CS, EE, MIS, etc. Feel free to put the issues and update the list.
