# 2018fall-cs-master-program-info
A collection of information for 2018 fall CS master programs.

## Index

- [General information on CS/DS masters](https://github.com/wenhanshi/2018fall-cs-master-program-info/tree/master/info)
- [Instructions & requirements of PS](https://github.com/wenhanshi/2018fall-cs-master-program-info/tree/master/ps)

## For BUPTers

Initially, this collection is only designed for preparing the applications for 2018-fall CS master programs. Generally, I prefer __professional__ master programs, which are __more than 1 year__, in the fields of __Computer Science__ and __Data Science__.

We're sharing them here for all BUPTers to learn more about programs, including CS, EE, MIS, etc. Feel free to put the issues and update the list and files.

## Update

I will attend CS@UIUC in fall, 2018. The other admissions include CS@Columbia, CSE@UCSD, Connective Media@Cornell Tech, CS@USC and DS@USC. See the [summary]() to my 2018-fall application. Hope the docs and result are helpful to you applicants.
